# Basis and still learning kramdown / markup

We received a West Elm mini-catalog in the mail and I noticed it in a
different way today. It had these little vignettes about how their
furniture is moving towards (not sure if it is) fair trade status and
how that benefits the suppliers that West Elm is using. Between that
catching my eye, as well as meeting the partner of one my work
colleagues on an event on Friday who works at West Elm, it made me
think more about whether when you see IT services, whether at the actual
site, or in reviews, do you feel and see the connect that your product
is making towards solving someone's problems or needs?

With a little more practice, I'll get better with the markdown :smile:
