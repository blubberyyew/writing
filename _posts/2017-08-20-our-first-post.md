# Start

I'm not much of a writer. I've tried to be a writer in someway or
another for a long time. Whether trying to maintain a journal or doing
blogs across Blogger or other tools, I'm not good. What I'm hoping for
with this is something more real. If you read writing from folks like
[Stratechery](https://stratechery.com/), this isn't even close. It's
like watching Peyton Manning play football against kids. But, stick with
me, I'll do my best to get better and write posts that are useful.

# Privacy and Market Dynamics

There isn't any, but, there should be. I don't like the idea of
ranting and raving about lack of privacy and all that. We make choices
and trade-offs. We want free email, free Facebook, etc. Those
companies mine our data and sell to advertisers - it's too
convenient. But, if there was a market ... stay tuned?
