This continues to be a challenge - the idea of how our data is managed.
There are too many services that are tied to providers owning our data.
It is inenvitable that Equifax would have gotten hacked. Their data is
too valuable for cyber crimes to ignore. I'm sure Equifax has a Security
Operations Center and it has worked to detect these attacks in the past,
but, this was too nefarious for them. 

One of the concepts that I'm starting to work on is the draw-down. We
have to begin to teach people how to draw-down from connected services -
almost move off what the internet provides and move back on in a more
secure and private way where the user is in control. Draw-down services
would become part of the new economy and will be challenged by existing
internet service providers because of the extreme value of the data that
they gather on you.
